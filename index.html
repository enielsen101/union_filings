	In 2020 John Malmborg, an independent audio engineer, was slated to present his work at the prestigious SXSW festival. But Covid derailed those plans. Malmborg eventually made it to SXSW in 2022, but he still needed regular employment to support himself.
</p>

<p>
	So he started working at SWF1, an Amazon fulfillment center outside Newburgh, New York. He’s also been involved in labor organizing at the same facility. But he says it’s difficult because workers are isolated from each other. And Amazon insists management deal with them one on one. A few weeks ago Malmborg and another worker were written up for insubordination simply for being present at the write up of a third worker.  
</p>

<p>
	“I think a lot of people are very aware of the conditions in these workplaces,” Malmborg said. “And I think there's an appetite to get the ball rolling with these labor movements.”
</p>

<p>
	The movements Malmborg referred to have seen petitions to form unions filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) rise from 1,269 in 2021 to 2,371 in 2024, an 86% increase.

	What’s a precedent for this moment in labor history?
</p>

<p>
	“There isn’t one,” according to John Logan, a professor of labor at San Francisco State University. “Labor movements have never been able to achieve this before,” he said.
</p>

<p>
	It was no accident the current phase of the labor movement arose in the wake of Covid, though policy and media also played a role. But the surge in filings with the NLRB has not resulted in a single new contract, which demonstrates how difficult it is to form a union. Even companies with progressive reputations remain staunchly anti-labor. And the second Trump administration has made it clear it opposes unions and hopes to do away with the NLRB altogether.
</p>

<p>
	The pandemic played a major role in recent efforts to form unions because it laid bare underlying inequities in the system, according to Nelson Lichtenstein, a professor of history at UC Santa Barbara. Workers experienced a “sense of betrayal that their employers were unconcerned about their safety and income,” said Lichtenstein.
</p>

<p>
	But Covid wasn’t the only cause of the labor renaissance. The workers involved also lived through the Great Recession, which created conditions where they couldn't buy a house, pay off student loans or get a living wage, especially in cities. 
</p>

<p>
	What’s more, according to Logan, the professor of labor, media and social media coverage of unionization efforts, for instance at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/technology/amazon-union-staten-island.html">an Amazon facility</a> in Staten Island in 2022, were also unprecedented and played a critical role in spreading efforts to organize. 
</p>

<p>
	Lastly, the Biden administration made changes to the NLRB that expanded the scope of who has the right to organize and made it easier to have a timely union election, according to Margaret Poydock, an analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. Those changes reversed Trump administration policies that saw filing petitions with the NLRB continuously <a href ="https://www.nlrb.gov/reports/nlrb-case-activity-reports/representation-cases/election/election-statistics">decline</a> from 2015 to 2021: if workers know their efforts are unlikely to succeed it’s less likely they’ll organize in the first place, according to Poydock.
</p>

<p>
	As many as 50% of workers want to join unions because they “provide better pay, benefits and working conditions,” according to Poydock. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics support her claim, showing that in 2024 weekly wages for union members were $200, or 17%, higher than non-union workers. That gap widens for certain demographics. For instance, in the same year unionized Hispanic men made over $300, or 33%, more than non-unionized Hispanic men per week.

<p>
	Still, the dramatic increase in petition filings with the NLRB has not resulted in a single new contract. “It’s extremely difficult to form a union in this country,” according to Lorena Roque, an interim director at CLASP, the Center for Law And Social Policy, a nonpartisan nonprofit. The NLRB is underfunded, and the process is lengthy. Once workers vote to form a union, the employer must recognize it. If the employer fails to do so, workers have to file an unfair labor practice charge, but there’s no monetary penalty for an employer’s failure to comply with labor law. 
</p>

<p>
	What’s more, unionization efforts are undercut by decades of policy. When employers’ free speech and private property rights clash with workers’ right to organize, “the courts have almost always side with employers,” according to Logan, the labor professor.
</p>

<p>
	Companies also spend some <a href = "https://www.epi.org/publication/union-avoidance/">$400 million</a> a year on anti-unionizing efforts and “right to work laws” dilute the ability to form unions. In the 26 states where such laws are in place union density is <a href = "https://www.epi.org/publication/union-membership-data/">significantly lower</a> than in states that do not have them.
</p>

<p>
	During the same years that saw a remarkable uptick in union petition filings there was also a similar uptick in unfair labor practice charges. For instance, charges against Starbucks rose from 5 in 2020 to 367 in 2021 to 545 in 2022. Starbucks in particular saw such a dramatic increase likely because organizing efforts were so visible at its stores and because the company’s then CEO Howard Schultz is so <a href = "https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/29/bernie-sanders-howard-schultz-starbucks-hearing-00089509">vocally</a> anti-union.
</p>

</script>
</div>

<p>
	Even companies with progressive stances on race, gender and sustainability remain resolutely anti-union. Unfair labor practice charges against Trader Joe’s, a company with a “progressive” reputation that sports chipper, “crunchy” signage in its stores, increased a great deal during the same years that complaints against Starbucks shot up. In fact, Trader Joe’s is now part of a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trader-joes-attorney-nlrb-unconstitutional_n_65b41e7ae4b014b873b11cc2">lawsuit</a> arguing the NLRB’s very existence is unconstitutional. “Progressive” companies “will do almost anything lawful or unlawful in order to crush efforts of workers to form unions,” said Logan, the professor of labor.
</p>

<p>
	During Trump’s first administration the NLRB advanced anti-union goals set out by the Chamber of Commerce, according to an EPI <a href = "https://www.epi.org/publication/unprecedented-the-trump-nlrbs-attack-on-workers-rights/">report</a>. During the first months of Trump’s second term he fired the NLRB’s General Counsel. Crystal Carey, his nomination to replace her, is a partner at a law firm that represents corporations such as Amazon and Tesla – and is also the same firm arguing the NLRB is unconstitutional. 
</p>

<p>
	Trump also fired NLRB board member Gwynne Wilcox several times over, leaving the agency without a quorum and therefore paralyzed. And the NLRB is now in DOGE’s <a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/28/doge-nlrb-cuts-democrats">crosshairs</a>. 
</p>

<p>
	Unions are facing a perilous moment and “could be practically wiped out by the end of the Trump administration,” according to Logan.
