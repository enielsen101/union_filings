## Methodology

# First dataset

The National Relation Labors Board tracks petitions to form unions and unfair labor practice charges by year and month. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks weekly wages for unionized and non-unionized workers by year. The data from the NLRB was exported on April 22, 2025 and May 4, 2025, respectively. The data from the BLS was copy and pasted on April 27, 2025.

I downloaded the dataset of all cases from the NLRB website. Then I filtered by the "RC" code, which is the one to form a union (as opposed to other codes for other actions). Then I organized the cases by fiscal year, which is how the NLRB files cases. I chose 2021-2024 because those years correspond to Covid, which played a major role in this story, and to changes the Biden administration made to the NLRB. I created a file for each and then collated them.  

Once I had filtered for each year I added a column for "Year" collated all four years and counted all instances of union filing petiitions and put them into a table and exported it.

# Second dataset

I downloaded the dataset for unfair labor practice charges from the NLRB website from 2017-2024. I wanted to expand the number of years here to see how they increased after Covid and the Biden administration made changes at the NLRB. I filtered the data for Trader Joe's and then once again created individual datasets for fiscal years 2019-2024 to see how many unfair labor practice charges had been brought against the company in each year. I repeated this for Starbucks and Amazon. I chose those three companies because they are all major entities and have seen very visible labor organizing at their stores and facilities. Once I had the number for each company I created a table counting all of them.

## Third dataset

I copy and pasted the weekly wage data from the BLS website onto an Excel sheet.
